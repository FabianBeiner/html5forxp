<p class="intro">If this web site is not available in your language, how about providing a translation?</p>

<p>This web site was translated by lovely people I found on Twitter who volunteered to provide their language skills. If you want to provide a language that is not supported yet, check out <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AhphLklK1Ve4dDRhdHRyUEV3cFVDNE51X3hneTFwa3c&hl=en#gid=0">the translation spreadsheet on Google Docs</a> and ask me for access rights.</p>

<p>There is no payment or anything involved, all I can offer you is a very heartfelt "thank you" and your name linked in the footer (if you check the different languages you can see all the people who provided translations).</p>

<p>Pretty simple, really...</p>
